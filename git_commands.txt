Gi allows us:
    - Store our code in a repository
    - Work in a team, each member have access to repository and make changes
    - Work on new features in separate branches and merge it to main branch later
    - Reverse back to a previous version of our code 

    (git clone) ${git-url}  ===> get repository from github
    (git add) . or path ===> add current directory to be uploaded to gihub
    (git commit -m 'message-content-here') ==> prepare content to push
    (git commit -am 'message') ==> shorthand for git add . and git commit ....
    (git push) ==> push my changes to github
    (git status) ==> get status of repository
