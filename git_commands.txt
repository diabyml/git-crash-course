Gi allows us:
    - Store our code in a repository
    - Work in a team, each member have access to repository and make changes
    - Work on new features in separate branches and merge it to main branch later
    - Reverse back to a previous version of our code 

    git clone ${git-url}  ===> get repository from github
    git add . or path ===> add current directory to be uploaded to gihub
